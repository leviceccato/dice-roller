      Dice Roller provides an easier way to calculate your rolls for tabletop RPGs by just plugging in the dice notation. This will usually look something like this '1d8+3'. 'd8' refers to the type of die, in this case an 8-sided die. The number preceding that refers to the number of those die, 1 in this case. You may also add and subtract modifiers from the result as shown.
